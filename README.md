# Introduction Site

This project is my personal introductory website, designed to showcase my skills in modern web development, but also to provide an engaging and interactive way to introduce myself. Have fun exploring the site, discovering fun hidden features and easter eggs.

A few notes on the technology used: This project uses Nuxt 3 and Vue 3 for an optimised and seamless front-end architecture, Pinia for state management and the Spotify iFrame API to integrate dynamic and interactive music features.
The music analysis is done in a Jupyter notebook using Python and the Spotify API. The analysis is performed daily using an action workflow.

Thank you for taking the time to explore my little application idea.
