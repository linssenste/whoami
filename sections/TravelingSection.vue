			<h1>European Adventures</h1>
			<p>I spent a few months this year travelling around Europe with my dog Jasper, exploring the continent by
				train.</p>
			<!-- <p style=" text-align: justify;">
				I set off across Europe with my dog and best friend, Jasper. By train and ferry, we explored
				breathtaking
				landscapes - from the sunny shores of Naples to the icy edge of the Arctic Circle. Along the Atlantic,
				Baltic and Mediterranean coasts, we captured moments that showcase the unique charm of each country.
				Explore
				our journey with this interactive map and photo gallery, with Jasper in the spotlight.
